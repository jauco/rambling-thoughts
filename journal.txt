 - Rambling thoughts on data

 - This is Sanne

 - And this is Renée

 - Sanne built an application for Renée
        - (Using javascript)

 - Renée thinks Sanne is very cool

 - Sanne wants build an app for lots of friends

 - But how does that work? Will all the apps comunicate with each other? That sounds hard!

 - Sanne has an idea.

 - He builds a database and all the apps comunicate with the same database.

 - Oh Sanne, you're so smart!

 - Wait, what's that? Sanne has another idea.

 - Hmm, I wonder what it is

 - Sanne adds an extra application on the server? A Http application!

 - Why would you do that Sanne? Why not connect directly to the database?

 - Because everyone is doing it? Oh Sanne, you know better than that reasoning.

 - Let me explain to you how cool a database is!
